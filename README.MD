## Snake - game
It's my second JavaScript project. I code it in 2019 for Client Applications course in Upper-Secondary Schools of Communications. The original name I gave it was "Wunsz Arthur."
## Some basic concepts that I learned:
- sometimes pure canvas is better choice
- original snake game logic
